question: Proposed solution evaluation criteria
question_advice: |
  Cultural fit is how well you and the individual or team will work together. If the supplier’s values and behaviour
  are similar to your organisation’s, they should be a good cultural fit.
  
  If you want to add ‘points’ to the individual cultural fit criteria, you must include them here, 
  eg ‘transparent and collaborative when making decisions - 15 points’
  
  Suggested criteria
  
  - Work as a team with our organisation and other suppliers
  - Transparent and collaborative when making decisions
  - Have a no-blame culture and encourage people to learn from their mistakes
