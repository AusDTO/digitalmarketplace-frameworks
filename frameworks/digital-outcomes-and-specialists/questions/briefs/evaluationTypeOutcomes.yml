options:
  - label: "Written proposal"
    description: >
       A written proposal can help you understand how suppliers plan to address your business goal and user needs. 
       It should be structured around the questions you want suppliers to answer. It’s normally the first evaluation 
       method buyers use.
  - label: "Case study"
    description: >
       A case study is a good way to see the work suppliers have done before. It can help you understand whether the 
       people who'll be working on your project have the right skills and experience.
  - label: "Work history"
    description: >
       A work history lists the previous work a supplier has done. It should give you a view of the skills and 
       experience of the team members who'll be working on your project.
  - label: "Reference"
    description: >
       A written reference is a good way of confirming whether a supplier has done the work they’ve said they’ve done. 
       You should always ask for references that relate to a specific timeframe, eg work they’ve done in the last 
       2 years.
  - label: "Presentation"
    description: >
       A presentation can help you understand a supplier’s approach to delivering an outcome, eg a practical 
       demonstration of a prototype or discovery kick-off meeting.
