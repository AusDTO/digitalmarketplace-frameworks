  - label: "Case study"
    description: >
       A case study is a good way to see the work suppliers have done before. It can help you understand whether the 
       people who'll be working on your project have the right skills and experience.
  - label: "Reference"
    description: >
       A written reference is a good way of confirming whether a supplier has done the work they’ve said they’ve done. 
       You should always ask for references that relate to a specific timeframe, eg work they’ve done in the last 
       2 years.
  - label: "Written proposal"
    description: >
       A written proposal can help you understand how suppliers plan to address your business goal and user needs. 
       It should be structured around the questions you want suppliers to answer. It’s normally the first evaluation 
       method buyers use.
  - label: "Interview"
    description: >
       An interview can help you understand whether a supplier or team has the skills needed to work on your project. 
       It will also help you see whether they will be a good fit for your existing team. You should follow an agreed 
       format in which you ask all suppliers the same set of questions.
