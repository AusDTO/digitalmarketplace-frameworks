question: Nice-to-have skills and experience
question_advice: |
  To find the best supplier to meet your needs, you should:

  - list as many types of skills and experience as you can
  - be specific about the skills and experience you're looking for

  If too many suppliers have all the essential skills and experience, you’ll use the nice-to-have skills and
  experience to exclude suppliers.

  You must tell suppliers if you want to score individual criteria.

  eg have experience recruiting users for government research
