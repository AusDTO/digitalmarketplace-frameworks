question: How many suppliers will be evaluated
question_advice: |
  Try not take too many suppliers through to the assessment stage.
  
  You must take the suppliers who have the most nice-to-have skills and experience through.
  
  If the number of suppliers who have the most skills and experience exceeds the number you give you here, 
  you must ask for evidence of skills and experience.
