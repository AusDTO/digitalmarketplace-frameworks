  -
    label: Fixed price
    description: >
      Choosing a fixed price approach means that the supplier owns most of the risk. They’re contractually bound 
      to provide all the work you specify in each particular ‘statement of work’ within the stated timeframe. 
      The supplier may charge more for owning more of the risk. A fixed price approach works best when the requirement
       is well defined so the supplier can provide an accurate quote without incorporating extra costs.
  -
    label: Time and materials
    description: >
      A time and materials approach means you own more of the risk. The supplier can send a pricing matrix showing 
      how long they need to provide the work. If it takes longer to do the work defined in a statement of work, you 
      will be charged on a day rate and expenses basis.
  -
    label: Capped time and materials
    description: >
      The capped time and materials approach combines elements of the fixed price and time and materials methods. 
      The supplier does the work on a day rate and expenses basis but you need to agree date which they can’t work 
      past. Most buyers choose a capped time and materials approach for alpha, beta and live. They also tend to 
      find that issuing lots of smaller statements of work, rather than one statement of work for each phase, 
      gives them more flexibility.
