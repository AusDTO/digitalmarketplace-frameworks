question: 'Technical competence'
question_advice: |
  Technical competence is how well the supplier can do the work you need them to do. It’s also known as 
  ‘technical merit and functional fit’. If a supplier has the right skills and experience, a good 
  understanding of your requirements, and works in an agile way, they should have the technical competence 
  to do the work.
  
  You must assess a supplier’s technical competence by reviewing their:
  
  - essential skills and experience
  - nice-to-have skills and experience
  - proposed solution
