   Providing a question and answer session is optional but it means you can explain your needs and answer questions quickly.
   
   If you want to have a question and answer session please outline:

  - The type of session you want to run. For example, a webinar, phone conference or meeting.
  - The date and time of your session.

  **Information you should include**

  Depending on the type of session you choose, you could also include:

  - software needed
  - the url
  - the phone number
  - the access code
  - the address (including postcode)
  - anything else needed to take part

  This information will only be available to eligible suppliers who have logged in.

  After the session, post all questions and answers to your brief page for all suppliers to see.
