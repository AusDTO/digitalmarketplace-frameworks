question_advice: |
   "Providing a question and answer session is optional but it means you can explain your needs and answer questions quickly.
   If you wish to have a question and answer session, provide the details here. For example:
   - the type of session you want to run, such as a webinar, phone conference or meeting
   - the date and time of the session (this should happen within 1 week of publishing your brief)

  Depending on the type of session, you could also include:
   - software needed
   - the url
   - the phone number
   - the access code
   - the address (including postcode)
   - anything else needed to take part

  This information will only be available to eligible sellers who have logged in.

  After the session you must add all questions and answers to your published brief so all suppliers can see them."
