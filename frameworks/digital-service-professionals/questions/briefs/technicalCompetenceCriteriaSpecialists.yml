  Technical competence is how well the supplier can do the work you need them to do.

  Evaluate specialists’ technical competence using criteria for:

  - essential skills and experience
  - nice-to-have skills and experience

  ##Giving points for individual criteria (optional)
  You can give points to individual criteria. For example, 'have experience designing services for users with low digital literacy – 15 points’. If you choose to add points, you must do it for all individual criteria.

  The points you give for nice-to-have skills and experience must be lower than the points you give for
