  "Do the cloud services you're providing for G-Cloud 7 have or support:"
 " - on-demand self-service? Is access to your cloud services, eg server time or network storage, automically available as needed without interaction between the supplier and the contracting body?
  - broad network access? Are your cloud services easily accessible over the network and across a wide range of platforms (eg mobile phones, tablets, laptops and workstations) and a mix of applications that are both thin (the bulk of data processing occurs on the server) and thick (most processing occurs on the local platform)?
  - resource pooling? Are your computing resources (eg storage, processing, memory and network bandwidth) pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. 
  - rapid elasticity? Can your cloud services be quickly, and sometimes automatically, scaled to serve the required number of users, according to demand?
  - measured service. Can your resource use (eg storage, processing, bandwidth and number of active user accounts) be monitored, controlled and reported to the contracting body?"
