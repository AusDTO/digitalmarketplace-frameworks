question: >
  Please confirm, by selecting YES or No, that the Cloud Service(s) that you are tendering for the Digital Marketplace in your response within the Service Submission Portal at question AQB1 (Award Questionnaire Section B â€“ see attachment 3 for guidance) have or support the following essential characteristics:
  On-demand self-service. A Contracting Body can unilaterally provide computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each Supplier.
  Broad network access. Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
  Resource pooling. The Suppliers computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the Contracting Body generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g. country, state, or data centre). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory and network bandwidth.
  Rapid elasticity. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the Contracting Body, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.
  Measured service. Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the Supplier and the Contracting Body of the utilized service.
