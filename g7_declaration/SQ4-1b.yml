question: >
 Have any of your organisation's tax returns submitted on or after 1 October 2012 been found to be incorrect as of 1 April 2013 or more recently because:
  
  
    - HMRC successfully challenged it under the General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR) or
      the 'Halifax' abuse principle?
  
    - a tax authority in a jurisdiction in which your organisation is
      established successfully challenged it under any tax rules or legislation
      that have an effect equivalent or similar to the GAAR or Halifax abuse
      principle?
  
    - the failure of an avoidance scheme that your organisation was involved in and that was notfied, or should have been notfied, under the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Scheme (DOTAS)?
